---Refactoring Homework---
WORK ON (BRAND STATEMENT?) AND RESUME. CHECK MILESTONES.
Double check with refactoring tools (didn’t end up using any)
Remember to use tab and shortcuts

To possibly do:
Change div tags
Change floats to css, create float.css
Change box layouts to “absolute, relative,"

Basics of what I’ve changed
1.	Changed div tags to semantic
2.	Created alts for images
3.	Heavily trimmed down html
4.	Reorganized messy css

Notes of trickery
1.	The cost-management.png had an unnecessary “/img>” tag at the end
2.	Trimmed down <h1>Hori<span class="seo">seo</span>n</h1> and edited
3.	Changed the main image from <div class=> to just <section>
4.	Changed beneath that to <main>
5.	Removed float left and right classes in html, deleted unnecessary css, and added those to other classes to make things simpler

Questionable:
1.	Should there be a proper header, not a part of the navigation?
2.	Should condense image classes because they are repetitive?
